# Let's try to find all the acronyms in our 'acronyms' dictionary
# We will iterate first over the irish english german dictionaries
# inside this we will iterate through the elements

# The 'thing' loop iterates over the string item!

for item in acronyms:

# we wanted the acronyms, instead we got the dictionaries - this isn't what we want
# but we are on the right path - we now know how to access the dictionaries
# with this strategy we can access each element in the new dictionaries quite easily

# we have to do one iteration over the keys in 'acronyms' and 
# then do a second interation over the keys in each entry in 'acronyms'
# which is why the acronyms[item] is needed
